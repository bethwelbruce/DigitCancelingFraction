# DigitCancelingFraction
The fraction  is a curious fraction. An inexperienced mathematician while attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that  is obtained by cancelling the s.

We shall consider fractions like, , to be trivial examples.

Which means fractions where trailing 0's are cancelled are trivial. So we will ignore all the cases where we have to cancel 0's.

You will be given 2 integers  and .  represents the number of digits in Numerator and Denominator, and  represents the exact number of digits to be "cancelled" from Numerator and Denominator. Find every non-trivial fraction, (1) where numerator is less than denominator, (2) and the value of the reduced fraction is equal to the original fraction.

Sum all the Numerators and the Denominators of the original fractions, and print them separated by a space.

Input Format

Input contains two integers  

Constraints



Output Format

Display 2 space separated integers that denote the sum of the Numerators and the sum of the Denominators respectively of original fractions.
Note You do not have to reduce the Numerator and Denominator.
